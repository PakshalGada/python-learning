# Task 3: Social Media Post Analyzer

## Topics Covered
- Strings
- Regular Expressions (RegEx)
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Lambda Functions

## Task Implementation

### Step 1: Text Processing
- Process sample social media posts or text files
- Clean the text (remove punctuation, convert to lowercase)
- Split posts into individual words

### Step 2: Word Analysis
- Count how often each word appears using dictionaries
- Find the most common words
- Calculate basic statistics (total words, unique words, average post length)

### Step 3: Extract Special Elements
Use patterns to find:
- **Hashtags**: words starting with # (using regular expressions)
- **Mentions**: words starting with @ (using regular expressions)
- **Links**: words containing "http" or "www"

### Step 4: Data Processing
- Use lambda functions to sort and filter data
- Identify common patterns in text using string methods
- Generate simple statistics about the analyzed content

### Step 5: Generate Analysis Report
Create a comprehensive report showing all findings
